# Archived Documentation - Consolidated

These files have been archived because their content has been consolidated into the 3 core documentation files.

## Why Files Were Archived

As part of the **consolidation to a single production path** (v2 only), the documentation was reduced from 13 files to 4 core files to eliminate cognitive overhead.

## Mapping of Archived Content

| Archived File | Consolidated Into | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **CODE_STANDARDS.md** | [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) | Code standards, type hints, error handling best practices |
| **REFACTORING.md** | [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) | Refactoring approach and improvements made |
| **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** | [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) | How to migrate from v1 to v2 (reference only) |
| **COMPLETION_REPORT.md** | [README.md](../README.md) | Project status and completion metrics |
| **INDUSTRY_STANDARD_SUMMARY.md** | [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) | Industry standards applied to v2 modules |
| **QUICK_START_REFACTORING.md** | [QUICK_START_REFACTORING.md](../QUICK_START_REFACTORING.md) | Quick start guide (retained - kept in root) |
| **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** | [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md) | Deployment procedures (consolidated) |
| **GITHUB_PUSH.md** | [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md) | GitHub push instructions (consolidated) |
| **PUSH_NOW.md** | This directory | Workflow file (deprecated with consolidation) |

## Core Documentation (What You Need)

**Use these 4 files:**

1. **[README.md](../README.md)** - Get started, understand project purpose
2. **[QUICK_START_REFACTORING.md](../QUICK_START_REFACTORING.md)** - Quick reference for key commands
3. **[DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md)** - How to deploy to production
4. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** - How systems work, debugging, code standards

## If You Need Historical Information

All archived files are still here if you need to review historical context or decision rationale. However:

- They are **not maintained**
- They **may contain outdated information** (reference v1 modules, old workflows)
- **Use consolidated versions instead** for accurate, current information

## Archive Date

Created: December 24, 2024  
Reason: Documentation consolidation (reduce cognitive load by 70%)
